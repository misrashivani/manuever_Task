        <p class="blog-textStart">Women have always been known to have great intuition, especially when it comes to
            their
            body reacting to certain conditions - emotionally, mentally or physically.</p>
        <p class="blog-text">These “feelings” tend to get “out of control” during specific phases of our life, the kind
            that we see in movies but have not explicitly discussed before it happens.</p>
        <p class="blog-text">We start to sense a shift in the way our body works; drastic mood swings with frequent
            tears or outbursts.</p>
        <h2 class="blog-text">
            <p class="sub-heading">The worst part?</p>
        </h2>
        <p class="blog-text">The way people start reacting to this outburst, responding like they think we’re going
            crazy. Honestly, we are not going crazy... It's just menopause!</p>
        <p class="blog-text">Menopause is a transitional period when our bodies start to wind down on our reproductive
            abilities.</p>
        <p class="blog-text">And it’s no fun ride. All the mood swings, hot flashes, night sweats, insomnia, joint
            pains, and the never-ending
            list of problems. Feels like we have a lot to deal with, by ourselves.</p>
        <p class="blog-text">But...</p>
        <p class="blog-text">Understanding and accepting these symptoms can help us simplify the process of solving them
            (as promised, as easy as 1, 2, 3)!</p>
        <p class="blog-text">Let us start with understanding the 3 stages of Menopause:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Perimenopause or Premenopause</li>
            <li>Menopause</li>
            <li>Postmenopause</li>
        </ol>

        <h2 class="blog-text">
            <u class="sub-heading">The 3 Stages of Menopause</u>
        </h2>
        <i class="blog-text"><u>Perimenopause</u></i>
        <p class="blog-text">Perimenopause or Premenopause can begin <b>several years before menopause</b>. This could
            last between a few
            months
            to about 10 years. However, on average it lasts about 4 years.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-text">What happens?</p>
        <p class="text1">Ovaries start to gradually lower estrogen production.</p>
        <p class="blog-text">This is a natural process of growing older and usually starts around the age of 40. In some
            cases,
            it could start as early as when women are in their 30s.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-text">
            This could mean a reduction in our fertility rate, therefore, women looking to start a family should try and
            utilize
            every open opportunity with their partner!</p>
        <p class="text1">Changes in the menstrual/period cycle</p>
        <p class="blog-text">The horror stories begin with the change in duration of our menstrual cycle- there could be
            longer gaps
            between
            periods or spotting between 2 cycles.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-text">Like, the frustration of not knowing when you will get your period next is not enough; the
            flow
            would differ too, making it heavier or lighter over time.</p>
        <p class="text1">Intensified PMS (premenstrual syndrome)</p>
        <p class="blog-text">Drastic and frequent mood swings are the most common signals, along with increased insomnia
            or hot flashes.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-text">This could increase our irritability level, losing our energy levels; getting tired even
            after
            sitting at work the entire day or taking longer weekend naps to recover from our workweek would be common.
        </p>
        <i class="blog-text"><u>Menopause</u></i>
        <p class="blog-text">The official menopause stage begins 12 months after the last menstrual period (bleeding).
        </p>
        <pre>What happens?</pre>
        <br>
        <p class="text1">Ovaries stop releasing eggs.</p>
        <p class="blog-text">This means there would be minimal production of estrogen.</p>
        <p class="blog-text">At this stage, getting pregnant could be significantly harder. Hence, we notice the use of
            hormonal therapy or IVF for childbirth.</p>
        <p class="blog-text">We start feeling “low”, with the constant need to cuddle in bed and watch Netflix instead
            of going out and getting drinks with our girlfriends.</p>
        <p class="text1">Intensified hot flashes and night sweats.</p>
        <p class="blog-text">Waking up in the middle of the night, aggressively throwing our blanket away or turning
            your fan on max even
            though the aircon is on full blast.</p>
        <p class="blog-text">Our body starts to feel warm or hot suddenly, with flushed red skin and increased heart
            rate; followed by suddenly feeling cold.</p>
        <p class="text1">Significant physical changes.</p>
        <p class="blog-text">The concept of “a minute on your lip, a lifetime on your hip” comes to reality. Eating one
            slice of cake for
            dinner could increase weight around our waist and abdominal region, with a reduction in our metabolic rate."
        </p>
        <p class="blog-text">It is also common to notice our hair and skin becoming drier and thinner; no amount of
            conditioner
            and lotion seem to absolutely solve this problem.</p>

                unwanted weight gain due to menopause.</a></p>
        <br>
        <i class="blog-text"><u>Postmenopause</u></i>
        <p class="blog-text">Yes, the troubles don’t end right at menopause. It is the stage where most of the severe
            menopausal
            symptoms decrease but it comes with additional side effects.</p>
        <p class="blog-text">What happens?</p>
        <img src="images/menopause.png" alt="" class="section3-img">
        <p class="text1">Increase in Follicle Stimulating Hormones (FSH)</p>
        <p class="blog-text">This increases dramatically as our ovaries shut down and drastically lower the level of
            estrogen in our body.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-text">By this point, we started noticing a lowered energy level - sleeping in by 7/8 P.M. after
            work is a norm.</p>
        <p class="text1">Higher risk of certain health conditions.</p>
        <p class="blog-text">Some of the common health problems that occur during postmenopause are diabetes, joint
            pains, osteoporosis, cholesterol and heart disease.</p>
        <p class="blog-text">This could be an alarming phase, where every visit to the doctor is like drawing a lottery
            ticket- we need to maintain a healthy lifestyle to combat such possibilities.</p>
        <p class="text1">Difficulty concentrating and memory lapses (often temporary)
        </p>
        <p class="blog-text">Forgetting your car keys, deadlines seem to increase over time. However, these are
            temporary symptoms of
            postmenopause.</p>
        <p class="blog-text">We face a reduction in brain-derived neurotrophic factors which could also cause depression
            and anxiety. Now we have identified the 3 stages of Menopause.</p>
        <p class="blog-text">Understanding the 3 most common symptoms amongst women is vital, allowing us to solve or
            reduce these
            problems.</p>

        </ol>
        <p class="blog-text">Going through menopause by yourself is hard! Especially because it affects our daily life!
            Symptoms like reduction in metabolic rates and estrogen levels that cause weight gain and increase the size
            of our abdomen; night sweats and flashes, joint pains that make us feel 30 years older...are just to name a
            few.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-text">Therefore, we have broken down understanding and solving menopause in 3 easy steps; which
            can make this journey a little less frustrating!</p>
        <p class="blog-text">We hope you can see that menopause does not have to be difficult and solving it can be as
            easy as 1, 2, 3!</p>
