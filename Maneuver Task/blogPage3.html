            Life was going pretty much smooth for him, working 5-days a week, jamming with friends over the weekends,
            partying till wee hours & eating junk food to his heart‚Äôs content ü§™ü§™
            <b>"Junkie"</b> as his friends would call him #Commmmuniti, #Truffles, #Glen‚Äôs and the kinds were his usual
            turfs!
        </p>
        <p class="blog-text">Like a typical millennial, he grew up in an excessively electronics-filled, insanely
            socially-networked virtual world. He too had
            <b> ‚ÄúLived Life, App-Wise‚Äù, </b>until that fateful day.<b> ‚ÄúWhy should you step out, when everything is
                available in just the click of a button. Snap-an-App & it's at your doorstep!!!‚Äù</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>
                <i>Life was App-solutely sorted!!</i>
            </b>
        </p>
        <p class="blog-text">Until the day, when he collapsed!! Like, literally!!!</p>
        <p class="blog-text">
            THAT fateful DAY ‚Äì He woke up with the feeling of acute pain and cramps all over his body. He curled up
            in his bed but the pain became unbearable. He couldn't believe it was happening to him, for all his life, he
            had never been sick before this time. He struggled to get up from the bed, but there was no energy in him.
            It was impossible to just keep lying down too. He tried to reach out to his close friend but couldn't
            connect as he must have been in transit to reach office. Damn these mobile networks !!! The domestic help
            was still a couple of hours away. There was a total blackout !!! He was alone and in immense pain, all his
            happy-sad memories flashed in front of his eyes. He couldn't recall for how long he suffered in bed until he
            somehow managed to grab a painkiller &amp; reached the hospital hours later.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-text">
            Back home, the family environment was very strict as his father, who was serving the Armed Forces
            carried a very disciplined profile, but his mother always used to balance it out. He was right royally
            pampered by both his mother &amp; sister, who till date happens to be his<b><i> ‚Äúpartner in crime‚Äù!!</i></b>
        </p>
        <p class="blog-text">
            For someone who has lived most of his growing up years in a controlled environment, the 4-yrs of
            Engineering College were like the breeze of fresh air. It was time to stretch the wing‚Äôs &amp; soar high.
            Although he was academically strong &amp; got picked up in the campus placement, life took him places, but
            there was no schedule of sleeping &amp; eating. His love for food was known in his gang. But as much as he
            enjoyed eating junk, not a single day has gone by, when he hadn‚Äôt missed his Mom-made-food !! She would love
            to cook for him &amp; fondly watch him relish it.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-text">
            &nbsp;Over a period of 7-8 years, he had gone free-willy. Long working hours, mostly sitting &amp; eating
            all 3 meals outside, had majorly affected his life-style. The weight had always been an issue with him. He
            was always chubby &amp; plump but now he weighed slightly less than 20 stones. And that day, his body just
            gave up on him. It was giving him singles earlier also but he, kind of, ignored it.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-text">
            That morning, he had somehow managed to pull up &amp; deposited himself to the hospital. To
            investigate, what could have gone wrong with the body, multiple blood tests were conducted, which would
            eventually rule out the possibilities of what all might not have been wrong with him. All medical reports
            fell under normal criteria, except the vitamin D3 levels were immensely low.
            <b>
                <i>HE CRACKLED OUT, "Bloody, vitamin D3, could knock out this 6 ft body!!"</i>
            </b>
            But that was the truth. We don't realise the importance of these essential nutrients &amp; the critical role
            that they play in our body for its general well being. The Doctors advised him to change his lifestyle
            completely. That episode had left him shaken. This was a wake-up call, kind of an alarm that his body gave
            him &amp; thankfully he got the alert!!!
        </p>
        <p class="blog-text">
            The years of conditioning done by his disciplinarian father now came into play!! He too had his
            father‚Äôs commitment, unlike him, he was never thrown in a life-threatening situation until then. It was the
            most crucial time for him to decide what he wanted from his life &amp; most importantly from himself!!
        </p>
        <p>AND SO, THE JOURNEY BEGAN‚Ä¶</p>
        <p class="blog-text">‚Äú<b>I have been staying alone in Bangalore, so changing routine was not that easy. From
                planning, shopping,
                cook, packing meals, tracking them, not missing workout was all on me. It definitely sounds simple for
                someone who has been doing it for years, but I have forever been used to app culture, food, shopping,
                clothes iron, in-house jobs everything on an app.‚Äù</b>
        </p>
        <p class="blog-text"><b>‚ÄúIt would have been easy to just give in to the temptations, years of unhealthy habits
                were controlling my
                psyche, subconsciously. I was fortunate to have my friends &amp; my mentors who stood by me like solid
                rocks. Initially, I followed a diet which didn‚Äôt take away the pizzas, pastas or paranthas from my meal
                but kept it as occasional. That made me have control over my food &amp; my mind too‚Äù.</b></p>
        <p class="blog-text">
            Food, especially junk food has the same effect on our minds such as any drug like morphine, as the
            feeling of satiation releases the happiness hormone, endorphins, which reduces the feeling of pain &amp;
            sadness. So a person who is on this journey of not weight loss or diet but of lifestyle change needs an
            equal amount of support from the significant others as any other compulsive behaviour-driven person or a
            substance abusers does.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-text">In his words,<b>‚ÄúI was fortunate to have Mohit, Nikita &amp; Sam (who is a doctor now) who
                never gave up on
                me, almost carried me through during the initial &amp; the most difficult time of my journey. After that
                day, I decided, never to look back. It was a conscious decision to network with serious health &amp;
                fitness freaks. While I mostly understood the game of losing weight, (YouTube Google are loaded with
                instant formulas to lose weight overnightü§™ü§™), I knew, something that took me 25 years to collect those
                extra kilos, will take at least 25 months before it starts showing any significant results. You see, for
                a 6ft tall person, I was 40-45 kgs overweight, I knew it would be an uphill climb, and boy, I was
                committed !! It was not easy to run with those extra kilos so had to take a holistic approach. While
                diet gave me jitters &amp; junk food was my calling. I really had to work on my psyche. Meditation &amp;
                Yoga came along in a big way, and so did the initial years of conditioning, done by my dadüòäüòä‚Äù.</b>
        </p>
        <p class="blog-text">
            Contrary to the common belief about social networking, his network was his support system in the true
            sense of the word. His friends stood by him during his struggle &amp; supported him in his journey of
            transformation, which is an on-going thing!!!
        </p>
        <p class="blog-text"><b>‚ÄúAfter around 3 months, I was clear in my mind that how I had to continue my journey to
                achieve this
                transformation, I had begun to get into the zone. Networking with genuine and fitness freaks - like the
                Champions, Neera &amp; Nmami worked wonders for my habit correction &amp; brought out the lifestyle
                changes that my body &amp; mind needed. (My Instagram is full of only crazy fitness celebs and not
                Bollywood celebrities.) It was here that I first spoke with Nmami- one of the mentors who helped me in
                my success story!!Workouts with the running group, Champions, really changed my routine more than
                food habits. For those crazy ‚Äì happy workouts routines with that bunch fitness freaks, I didn‚Äôt mind
                getting up as early as 4.30 am on a weekend.</b></p>
