        <p class="blog-textStart">We hear “AI has both a bright side and a dark side. We should enhance the former and
            weaken the latter for developing responsible AI”</p>
        <p class="blog-text">We cannot disagree but would like to add one more remark to it – “We should be prepared to
            fend off bad guys who attempt to exploit the dark side of AI”. </p>
        <p class="blog-text">We all know that we cannot eliminate bad guys. We only can build the defense line against
            them. We must prepare against vicious AI deployed by malicious guys for malign objectives. Among the
            malicious guys are dictators and autocrats, and among the malign objectives is destruction of the values of
            democracy.</p>
        <p class="blog-text">The domain we are active in is Digital Identity. Naturally we have an obligation to
            consider what we can do for the defence of democracy from digital identity’s view point.</p>

        <h1 class="blog-text">
            <span class="sub-heading">AI Program with No Identity</span>
        </h1>
        <p class="blog-text">AI might become extremely excellent in mimicking human thinking. Mimicked thinking,
            however, is just different to human thinking.</p>
        <p class="blog-text">Human thinking is supported, reflected, influenced and inspired by humans’
            internal/external body senses and emotion, feeling and mood that come from them, as well as history of
            social and personal experiences and time-honoured wisdom born from all of them. ‘Identity’ is made up of
            these elements which can hardly be an object of mathematical calculations. </p>
        <p class="blog-text">Mimicked thinking may be feasible without Identity, but human thinking is never possible
            without Identity. Each separate AI program, if given an ‘identification code’, can never be an object of
            ‘Identity Authentication’. Should we mess up here, we might be walking on the road towards a digital
            dystopia.</p>
        <p class="blog-text">We have to make it clear that we are facing the AI that does not have and will never obtain
            Identity.</p>
        <h1 class="blog-text">
            <span class="sub-heading">Conclusion</span>
        </h1>
        <p class="blog-text">
            What makes humans’ identity can make a defense against the perils of Identity-less Artificial Intelligence.
            What can contribute to the solid digital identity platform can also contribute to the solid defense line
            against the perils of vicious artificial intelligence.
